# Razavi_Analog_CMOS_python
· This is a project intends to model and visualize the Analog circuit structure described in Behzad Razavi's Design of Analog CMOS Integrated Circuit (second edition) using Python.

· Using Matplotlib and mpl-interactions as auxiliary python library  
· This project is still updating.
· Detailed information will be updated on my CSDN blog: 

Model list:
1.  MOS_modelling:
   · NMOS and PMOS 0.5um Level-1 modelling.
   · modelling of Threshold voltage variation caused by Body effect 
   · Drain current calculation
   · Transfer characteristic curve plot in reference to different V_GS
   · Output impedance and Intrinsic resistance calculation
   · Transconductance calcaulation
